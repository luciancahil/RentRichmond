      <p><strong><u>Who are we?</u></strong></p>
      <p>We are <strong>R</strong>ichmond <Strong>E</Strong>lectors <strong>N</strong>eeding <strong>T</strong>enancy.</p>
      <p>We stand for higher density, more affordable housing, we stand for cleaner living, and we stand for a world where everyone can walk to work.</p>
      <p>We advocate for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Changin Richmond-Landowne to be 100% rentals.</li>
        <li>Commiting 20% of the rentals to affordable units.</li>
        <li>Reserving the units for Lansdowne Workers.</li> 
        <li>Building the affordable units first.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the past several years, the cost of housing has skyrocketed, far outpacing income. It has created a world where everyone is paying more for worse housing.</p>
      <p>The time is now. Join in solidarity, as fight for a more clean, more affordable, and more compact City of Richmond. Join us in building a city designed around it's residents, not its developers.</p>
